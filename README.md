Search for markets to promote content related to Web Development and Mobile Development for an E-Learning Company

In this project, we'll aim to find the two best markets to advertise our product in â€” we're working for an e-learning company that offers courses on programming. Most of our courses are on web and mobile development, but we also cover many other domains, like data science, game development, etc.

The objective of this project is to strengthen statistical skills such as - summarizing distributions, measuring variability of a distribution, and understanding of z-scores. The project will help in combining these skills together to perform practical statistical data analysis.

<b>Project-Case-Scenario: </b> An E-Learning company offers courses on programming spanning multiple domains - web/mobile development, game development, data science etc. The company wants to identify the best markets to invest in advertising, in order to promote it's products and create a consumer base with learners/ coders.

<b>Approach Taken: </b>To identify the best markets to promote the courses, following becomes pre-requisite information about the potential learners, for the E-Learning company:

- What people actually want to study - most preferred courses/ roles?
- What is the economic investment range - how much money, learners are willing to invest in online education?
- Investments in terms of time - the duration of time learners would like to spend in courses.
- Demographic information such as their current residence, current employment status and its type, educational qualifications etc.
    
<b>Survey Data Set: </b>The above and related information was collected by the E-Learning platform [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) in a survey, they conducted in 2017. Since the freeCodeCamp runs [a popular Medium Publication](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/) with over 400,000 followers, they received responses from coders/ learners with diversified interests and not just web development. They made the results as well as the data of this survey available under free distribution license.

The e-learning company intends to utilize this survey data, instead of conducting a new one - for both economic reasons and also the variety of responses available in dataset. 

The dataset can be accessed from the git repository [here](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/2017-new-coder-survey).

<b>Sample or Population?</b> Whether this data has been considered as population or sample data - will be answered during the workflow. <font color = crimson><i>A decent reason to keep scrolling!</i></font>
